		General Approach

Define game objective
	- Maneuver the player to the end?
	- Defeat enemies
	- collect items or points

Clearly define all players (actors) that will be featured in the game
	- user player
	- enemies or interacted moving players
	- in-game objects and assets
	- walls (which include platforms, ground, ceilings, etc)

Decide on specific approaches
	- Use a physics engine like Pymunk?
	- 

Develop Image assets
	- Use pixilart?
	- Animations?

Architecture
	- Maybe quickly develop certain aspects to make sure the game idea or part of idea actually works
	- Clean up as we go
	- Optimize it in the end if needed
